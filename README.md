# Proof-of-Concept: Crypto Toy

Just messing around with Go-lang and crypto APIs.

I have some ideas for utilities I'd like to build with the Go-lang crypto APIs, but I just want to get more comfortable messing around in the language before I start something I want to keep.

This is probably going to be throw-away code, but if anyone's interested... it's here for all to see.

## TODO

- **File I/O:**
    - [ ] Interpret a command flag as a file path and resolve it to absolute path.
    - [ ] Read raw file content in a way that will feed into crypto APIs as keys and messages.
    - [ ] Write generated content to a file.
- **Content Use:**
    - [ ] Detect PEM/DER on input and parse to ASN.1
