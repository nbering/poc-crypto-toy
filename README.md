# Proof-of-Concept: Crypto Toy

Just messing around with Go-lang and crypto APIs.

I have some ideas for utilities I'd like to build with the Go-lang crypto APIs, but I just want to get more comfortable messing around in the language before I start something I want to keep.

This is probably going to be throw-away code, but if anyone's interested... it's here for all to see.
